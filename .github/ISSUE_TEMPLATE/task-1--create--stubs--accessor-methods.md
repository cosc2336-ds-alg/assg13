**Description**

The first task is to create function stubs for the first 4 accessor methods for this assignment.
The goal is to make sure you project can compile and run with the function declarations added,
and passes the first set of unit test tasks given for the assignment.

This task is necessary before beginning the real work for this assignment as it is tough
to test these function until you have some things implemented that do real work, such as
adding and removing items from the set.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- Make sure that all of these functions are declared as `const` member functions, because
  none of these functions should actually cause the `Set` object to be changed or 
  modified in any way when called, they all return information about the `Set` only.
