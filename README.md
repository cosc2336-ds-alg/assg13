title: 'Assignment STL: Using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)'
author: 'COSC 2336: Data Structures and Algorithms'
date: 'Spring 2024'
---


# Objectives
- Understand how templates are used in HLL like C++ to provide
  generic containers.
- Apply ideas of algorithmic complexity to understand tradeoffs
  of using different STL containers.
- Familiarize yourself with using basic containers, list, vector,
  set, maps, and abstractions such as queue, stack, priority queue.

# Description
This assignment is open ended.  I have not given specific tasks
to do, but described tasks you can complete to get points for this assignment.


# Overview and Setup

For this assignment you will be given the following files that you will be
using and adding code to for this assignment.

| File Name                 | Description                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `assg13-tests.cpp`        | Unit tests for the Set class you are to implement.                   |

As usual, before starting on the assignment tasks proper, you should make sure
you have completed the following setup steps.

1. Copy the assignment repository on GitHub using the provided
   assignment invitation link for 'Assignment Classes' for our current
   class semester and section.
2. Clone the repository using the SSH url to your local class DevBox
   development environment. Make sure to open the cloned
   folder and restart inside of the correct Dev Container.
3. Confirm that the project builds and runs, though no tests will be
   defined or run initially.  If the project does not build on the first
   checkout, please inform the instructor.
4. You should create the issue for Task 1 and/or for all tasks for the assignment
   now before beginning the first task.  On your GitHub account, go to issues,
   and create it/them from the issue templates for the assignment.  Also you
   should close the initial Pull request that should be automatically
   opened for you, so that you can open your own when committing your work.

There are actually no files beyond a stub test file with an example of a test
of an STL list.  You will have to add in your own tests and/or files for this
assignment.


# Assignment Tasks

For this assignment demonstrate using the C++ standard template library
containers and algorithms for points.  You need to come up with your own
tasks, add the code and files to the project, and get them to build and run.
Some suggested tasks.

1. Reimplement the queue assignment functions but use STL queue and stack
   objects instead of our hand built ones.
2. Demonstrate using maps and ordered maps.  What is the backing store used
   for each?  Show adding and iterating over the items in the maps.
3. Demonstrate using list and vector.  What is the difference.  Show using
   multiple member methods to add items to these containers and get information
   about the containers.  Show how vector can be accessed using operator[].
4. Demonstrate using the set STL container.
5. Demonstrate using a priority queue, as we did for the queue assignment.
   Create a priority queue of items and show that items are removed by
   priority.
6. The STL library also contains algorithms in addition to data
   structures and containers.  Demonstrate some of these, especially how
   to sort STL containers using STL sorting methods.


## Program Style

At some point you will be required to follow class style and formatting guidelines.
The VSCode environment has been set up to try and format your code for some of these
guidelines automatically to conform to class style requirements.  But not all 
style issues can be enforced by the IDE/Editor.  The instructor may give you feedback
in your pull comments and/or create issues for you for the assignment that you need to 
address and fix.  You should address those if asked, and push a new commit that fixes
the issue (or ask for clarification if you don't understand the request).  In general
the following style/formatting issues will be required for programs for this class:

1. All programs must be properly indented.  All indentation must be consistent and lined
   up correctly.  Class style requires 2 spaces with no embedded tabs for all code 
   indentation levels.  The editor style checker should properly indent your code when you
   save it, but if not you may need to check or correct this if code is misaligned or not
   properly indented.
2. Variable and function names must use `camelCaseNameingNotation`.  All variable and function
   names must begin with a lowercase letter.  Do not use underscores between words in
   the variable or function name.  Often function names will be given to you, but you
   will need to create variables, and maybe some functions, that conform to the naming
   conventions.
   - Global constants should be used instead of magic numbers.  Global constants are
     identified using `ALL_CAPS_UNDERLINE_NAMING`.
   - User defined types, such as classes, structures and enumerated types should use
     camel case notation, but should begin with an initial upper case letter, thus
	 `MyUserDefinedClass`.
3. You are required to use meaningful variable and function names.
   Choosing good names for code items is an important skill.  The code
   examples and starting code tries to give examples of good and
   meaningful names.  In general, do not use abbreviations.  Single
   variable names should be avoided, except maybe for generic loop
   index variables `i`, `j`, etc.  Make your code readable, think of
   it as writing a document to communicate with other developers (and
   with your instructor who will be evaluating your code).
4. There are certain white space requirements.  In general there should
   usually never be more than 1 blank line in a row in your code.
   Likewise there should usually not be more than 1 blank space on a
   line.  There should be 1 blank space before and after all binary
   operators like `+`, `*`, `=`, `or`.
5. Function documentation is required for all regular functions and
   all class member functions.  You need to follow the correctly
   formatted Doxygen function documentation format.  We will use
   function documentation generation, and you should be sure your
   documentation can be built without emitting warnings or errors.
   Likewise all files should have a file header documentation at the
   top.  You should edit the file header of files where you add in new
   code (not simply uncommenting existing code).  Make sure the
   information has your correct name, dates, and other information.
6. Practice using proper Git commit messages.  You should refer to 
   issues and tasks correctly in commit messages.
